*Marty Willshire* has been serving fresh fish since the early 1900's in this small east coast town.I'd imagine they will still be in business deep into the 200's.The food and presentation there si fantastic!Plus the views from thrire outdoor dining patio are picutresque.

The atomasphere makes one feel like they just arrived at port.Skull caps and winbreakers hang from fish hooks on the walls.

The talbes look lke they drifted ashore during the last storm.

The agenda for this outing consisted of:

1. Drinks
2. Soup and Salad
3. Main Course
4. Dessert
5. Final Review

### Drinks

They have a full service bar that has everything from your run of the mill beer to liquerrs and mixed drinks, but these salty dogs are well known for therir improt fo rums. It's as if they have their own staff of pirates smuggling the stuff up from the Caribbean.

### Soup and Salad

I had to try their clam chowder. It was okay. I guss I expected more from chowder in a Main restaurant. My wife had a garden salad.Nothing too special, but the presentation was nice. The soup and salad were serviceable.

### Main Course
I am a huge, huge fan of fish tacos. The word on the streets of Geogetown is that willshire's has the best. So I had to give them a try.

They offer:

- Smoked Salmon
- Cod
- Seared Ahi
- Mahi Mahi

I rolled with the seared ahi, three of them.

Again, presentation was amazing. Alas, the flavor of therse puppies was just not there, I think they may have needed some sauce. Ever paired with a beer I couldn't bring out any pop in flavor.

### Dessert

Usually I reserve my donut eating for Sunday mornings, but when in Rome! A faimily friend told us a secret:

> Ask about the donuts at dessert!

These things were top notch!

a pretty good cap to an all around good meal.
